## Project Overview
We chose this dataset because we both not only have a passion for working out and staying fit, but as well as a passion for cooking and a strong interest in healthy eating. Analyzing this data allows us to discover new recipes to try in our own kitchen and to better understand the nutritional value and benefits of different foods. This knowledge can helps us make informed choices to support our fitness goals while still enjoying delicious and healthy meals.
